        <h2>What is Postcrossing?</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to allow anyone in India to send and
          receive postcards from all over the world! The idea is simple: for
          each postcard you send, you will receive one back from a random
          postcrosser from somewhere in the world.
        </p>

              <h3>1. Write a postcard</h3>
              <p>
                The first step is to request to send a postcard — we'll give you
                the address of a random member and a Postcard ID (e.g.,
                IN-12345). Pick a postcard, write a friendly message along with
                its Postcard ID and the address given. Don't forget the stamps!
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
              <h3>2. Post it</h3>
              <p>
                Now all you need to do is mail the postcard from your nearest
                postbox or post office. When your postcard arrives, its
                recipient will register it using its Postcard ID. This will make
                you eligible to receive a postcard from another member — and
                where your postcard will come from is a surprise!
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
              <h3>3. Hurray! You've got mail!</h3>
              <p>
                One day, you'll check your mailbox and a postcard from someone
                far away will be waiting for you!
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
              <h3>4. Register the postcard</h3>
              <p>
                Now it's your turn to register the postcard using its Postcard
                ID. That's it! You can have several postcards traveling at the
                same time. The more you send, the more you will receive!
